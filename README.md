# kmeans-cuda
Final project from CS475 Parallel Programming. Improving an existing k-means clustering implementation with CUDA parallelization.

The `parallel-kmeans` directory contains our improved code as well as the base code we are building off of. Source: [http://users.eecs.northwestern.edu/~wkliao/Kmeans/index.html](http://users.eecs.northwestern.edu/~wkliao/Kmeans/index.html)

Our modified files are `omp_new_kmeans.c` and `omp_new_main.c`
